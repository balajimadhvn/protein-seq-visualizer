**Protein Sequence Viewer**

The Protein Sequence Viewer is a comprehensive web application designed for bioinformatics analysis of protein sequences. Users can input protein sequences either by directly pasting them in FASTA format or by uploading a file. The tool calculates essential molecular properties such as molecular weight and predicts the isoelectric point (pI) to understand the biochemical characteristics of the protein. Additionally, it utilizes algorithms to predict secondary structure elements like alpha helices, beta strands/sheets, and coils, providing insights into the potential structural and functional properties of the protein sequence.

Built using a combination of JavaScript for interactivity, HTML for structure, and CSS for styling, the Protein Sequence Viewer offers an intuitive interface that allows users to explore and analyze protein sequences efficiently. Whether you're a bioinformatics researcher, student, or enthusiast, this tool serves as a valuable resource for gaining deeper insights into protein sequences and their biological significance.

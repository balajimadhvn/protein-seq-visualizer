**Protein Sequence Viewer**

The Protein Sequence Viewer is a web application for bioinformatics analysis of protein sequences. Users can input protein sequences in FASTA format directly or upload files for analysis. The tool calculates molecular properties such as molecular weight and predicts the isoelectric point (pI), providing insights into the biochemical characteristics of the protein. Additionally, it predicts secondary structure elements including alpha helices, beta strands/sheets, and coils, offering insights into the protein's structure and function.

Features:
Input protein sequences via direct input or file upload (FASTA format).
Calculate molecular properties: molecular weight, isoelectric point (pI).
Predict secondary structure elements: alpha helices, beta strands/sheets, coils.
Intuitive interface built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
Accessible via [proteinseqviewer.com](http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html).
Usage:
Input a protein sequence in FASTA format or upload a file.
Click "Submit" to analyze the sequence.
View calculated molecular properties and predicted secondary structure.
